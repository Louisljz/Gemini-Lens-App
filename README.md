# Gemini-Lens (Mobile App)

In my country, there exists an inequality affecting visually impaired individuals who lack access to essential accessibility services. This has driven me to create a mobile app that can harness the power of AI to offer a transformative solution. By enabling the visually impaired to understand the world around them, this app directly aligns with two crucial United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs): Goal 3 - "Good Health and Well-being," and Goal 10 - "Reduced Inequalities."

The app is constructed using the Flutter framework for the frontend, while the backend relies on Google AI Studio's Gemini Pro-Vision Model, accompanied with continuous Trulens Evaluation of LLM performance in Gemini-Lens' Hosted Fast-API server on Google Cloud Run Service.

The app has a very simple user interface: a camera preview and a mic button for them to speak up, then the query transcribed, along with the image captured will be processed and the response will be spoken back to blind users.
